# CI is the source of truth

Do not run tests, linters or builds locally to verify a change: write the code
and the tests, commit, push to `main`, and read the run with `gh run list` and
`gh run view --log-failed`, waiting for it in the background per
[[a-wait-runs-in-the-background]]. Reading the code locally is still right and
cheap: `grep` and file reads are how the useful findings surface.

**Why:** the jobs between them want Python, Node, four tree-sitter grammars and
eight tools this machine does not otherwise carry, and CI checks every gate at
once.

**How to apply:** a green push publishes to PyPI and force-moves `latest` by
itself, so there is no version to hold back, and a commit that should not be
published is a commit that should not be pushed. The change is done when each
run the push started is green, per [[find-a-run-by-the-full-hash]].
