# A wait runs in the background

Waiting for a workflow run, or for anything else that takes minutes, is done
with `Bash` and `run_in_background: true`, which notifies once when the command
exits, or with `Monitor`, which notifies once per event; never with a foreground
`sleep`, `gh run watch` or polling loop in the session's own shell.

**Why:** a cron reminder fires only while the session is idle. A foreground wait
holds the session busy for the whole run, so the autopilot's standing rules stop
arriving exactly while a push is in flight, and the user cannot type either.
10ulabs.com, api.10ulabs.com and wan-synthesizer hold the same rule for the same
reason.

**How to apply:** start the wait in the background, end the turn, and act on the
notification. `gh run watch <id> --exit-status --interval 60` is fine inside the
background command; it is the foreground that is the problem.

The interval is there because `gh run watch` polls every 3 seconds by default,
and over a long run that trips GitHub's secondary rate limit. Once it has
tripped, the watch and every `gh` call after it answer HTTP 403 while `gh api
rate_limit` still shows every bucket full, and the limit clears only after
several minutes without a call. So when a `gh` call answers 403 that way, the
next one waits behind a background `sleep` rather than retrying at once, since
each retry keeps the limit tripped.

Idle still means idle: the autopilot's wait reminder forbids diagnosis, edits
and commits while the run is in progress. Find the run per
